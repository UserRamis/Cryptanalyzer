# Cryptanalyzer
Task: write a program that works with the Caesar cipher.

The cryptographic alphabet is based on all the letters of the Russian alphabet and punctuation marks (. , ”” : - ! ? SPACE). If you come across characters that are not included in our cryptographic alphabet, just skip them.

Mandatory requirements The program should have 2 modes:

Encryption/decryption. The program must encrypt and decrypt the text using the specified cryptographic key.

The program should get the path to a text file with the source text and create an encrypted text file based on it.

Cryptanalysis by brute force method

The program must crack the encrypted text transmitted as a text file.

If the user chooses brute force (brute force, brute force search), the program must independently, by brute force, pick up the key and decrypt the text.
